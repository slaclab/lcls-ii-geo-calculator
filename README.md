# lcls-ii-geo-calculator
Python tools for diffractometer geometry calculations for LCLS-II 

Functionalities include (most all still under development to some extent):
- data input via CIF file (adding vasp file support)
- calculation of goniometer/detector angles based on specified incidence or exit angle
- visualization of samples in 3d space relative to lab space

# Requirements
See requirements.txt for necessary packages.
This project is written for python 3 and in particular the GUI may not run in python 2.

# Running the GUI
The file GeometryCalcsGUI will start the interface when run.

# Notes for future development
